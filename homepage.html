            <h2 class="headingR"> What Is Cafe Ease?</h2>
            <p class="paraR">Cafe Ease was a cafe created by Madison Young to ensure students were able to find a place to study in peace. While most establishes focus on
            the environment and socialization aspect, Cafe Ease was created to ensure socialization was not an expectation for students who may want a quieter dining experience.
            Made similar to traditional cafes, tables and a counter space are offered to customers who want a typical experience, but on the second floor is separated into corrals 
            for customers to find peace with themselves, set up in a similar fashion to Japan's restuarants where little interaction is necessary.
